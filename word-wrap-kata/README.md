## Word Wrap Kata

This Kata will be done from scratch. The main goal of this exercise is to understand the Transformation Priority Premise (TPP). Combining the use of TDD and learnings from the previous exercises, the attendees will reach a clear and simple solution.

- **Estimated time:** 2 hour
- **Format:** Pairs

### The Problem

You write a class called Wrapper, that has a single static function named wrap that takes two arguments, a string, and a column number. The function returns the string, but with line breaks inserted at just the right places to make sure that no line is longer than the column number. You try to break lines at word boundaries. Like a word processor, break the line by replacing the last space in a line with a newline.

## Run tests

You can run the tests by running:

`npm run test`

If you want to run the tests in watch mode, you can run:

`npm run test:watch`

Also, you can run the tests with coverage by running:

`npm run test:coverage`

## Run in the browser

You can start server in development (with hot reload) by running:

`npm run dev`

Or in production mode by running:

`npm run serve`

> No matter which command you run, you can access the application by clicking the link provided in the terminal.
